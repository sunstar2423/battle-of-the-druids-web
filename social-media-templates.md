Hey r/WebGames! 

I just finished my first web game - a complete turn-based RPG called "Battle of the Druids" that runs entirely in your browser.

**Features:**
- 4 character classes (Knight, Wizard, Rogue, Soldier)
- 9 unique battle locations
- Equipment progression system
- Local save system (no account needed)
- Mobile-friendly touch controls

It's completely free to play and requires no downloads. I built it with Phaser.js and it's been a fun learning experience converting from a desktop Python game to web.
