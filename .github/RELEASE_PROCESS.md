# Release Process Guide

This document outlines the release process for Titanblade Games, including semantic versioning, release automation, and deployment procedures.

## üìã Release Types

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0) - Breaking changes or major new game releases
- **MINOR** (0.X.0) - New features, new game modes, or significant enhancements  
- **PATCH** (0.0.X) - Bug fixes, small improvements, or content updates

### Release Categories

| Type | Version Pattern | Example | Description |
|------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| **Major** | X.0.0 | 3.0.0 | New game launch, major architecture changes |
| **Minor** | X.Y.0 | 2.1.0 | New features, game modes, or significant updates |
| **Patch** | X.Y.Z | 2.1.1 | Bug fixes, balance changes, small improvements |
| **Pre-release** | X.Y.Z-alpha/beta.N | 2.1.0-beta.1 | Testing versions before official release |

## üöÄ Release Workflow

### Automatic Releases (Recommended)

1. **Create and push a tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag v2.1.0
   git push origin v2.1.0
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions automatically:**
   - Generates changelog from commit history
   - Creates release packages for web and Python versions
   - Publishes GitHub Release with assets
   - Deploys to production (for stable releases)
   - Updates CHANGELOG.md

### Manual Releases

1. **Navigate to Actions tab in GitHub**
2. **Select "Release Management" workflow**
3. **Click "Run workflow"**
4. **Enter release version** (e.g., v2.1.0)
5. **Choose if it's a pre-release**
6. **Click "Run workflow"**

## üì¶ Release Assets

## üîÑ Branch Strategy

### Main Branch

- **Protection:** Requires PR reviews
- **Deployment:** Auto-deploys on tag creation
- **Quality:** All tests must pass

### Development Branch (Optional)
- **Purpose:** Integration of new features
- **Merging:** Feature branches merge here first
- **Testing:** Automated testing and review
- **Promotion:** Merged to main for releases

### Feature Branches
- **Naming:** `feature/description` or `bugfix/issue-number`
- **Lifecycle:** Created from main, merged via PR
- **Requirements:** Tests, documentation, review

## üè∑Ô∏è Tagging Strategy

### Tag Format
- **Pattern:** `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE]`
- **Examples:** `v2.1.0`, `v2.2.0-beta.1`, `v3.0.0-alpha.2`

### Tag Creation
```bash
# Create annotated tag with message
git tag -a v2.1.0 -m "Release version 2.1.0"

# Push tag to trigger release
git push origin v2.1.0

# Create pre-release tag
git tag -a v2.1.0-beta.1 -m "Beta release 2.1.0-beta.1"
git push origin v2.1.0-beta.1
```

## üîß Emergency Releases

### Hotfix Process

1. **Create hotfix branch from main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Fix the issue and test thoroughly**

3. **Create PR to main:**
   ```bash
   git push origin hotfix/critical-bug-fix
   # Create PR via GitHub
   ```

4. **After merge, create emergency release:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git tag v2.1.1
   git push origin v2.1.1
   ```

### Rollback Process

1. **Identify last known good version**
2. **Revert deployment to previous release**
3. **Create rollback tag if needed**
4. **Communicate issue to users**
5. **Fix issue and create new release**
